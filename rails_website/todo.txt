Todo:

* Style the pages.








-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Re-run compare


* start using the built in caching functions, and use some method to generate all the pages
* from the cache :-)
* 

* 

  * Figure out how to use "route" to make nice URLs for the other pieces
  * add route so we can cache the compare function
Revisit Co-Occuring in same module
  * Cleanup utils.. cleanup sites with no modules (probably uneeded)
  *   * Show keys on the Module Browse Page, in a similar way to how values are shown.
Ok,
  Now that I've fixed frequency.. Or so I think.

1) A test to make sure the numbers match up for all 3 of the ways  CHECK
   of generating numbers :-)  (i.e. in pconfig_flat)


2) Redo the compare functions to work with the sets of integers (instead of the old way) [DONE]

3) Redo the Co-Occurance stuff to work with new frequency. [DONE]

4) Graphical Filter.. i.e. a way to highlight uncommon items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think I am ready to build out the web interface.

I also need to do things like calculate "raw similarity"

and stuff.

i.e. build out the comparison functions more.

compare groups of PHP info files.


---------------------
Web interface is pretty good.

* need something to delete sites that have no modules.

* need something while creating sites to "delete that site"


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redo lada similarity calculations.

think about how different filters, could make less data available.

-- show both people's key/value pairs for each module. -- in the comparison function.
